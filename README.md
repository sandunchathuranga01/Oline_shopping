# Oline_shopping
 
A program is developed to manage an online shopping system.
Through this program a console system is implemented where the manager can add new products, delete if required, print, and save as described in detail below.
It also features a graphical user interface (GUI) where a user can select various products and add them to the shopping cart.
Also, the products added to the shopping cart and the final price are displayed and discounts are given there.
Here JAVA OOP concepts and java swing have been used as grants.
